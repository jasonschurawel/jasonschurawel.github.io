# 🚨 URGENT: Fix GitHub Actions Permissions

## The 403 Error You're Seeing

```
remote: Write access to repository not granted.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jasonschurawel/jasonschurawel.github.io.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

This means GitHub Actions doesn't have permission to create/push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 🔧 **STEP 1: Fix Repository Settings (REQUIRED)**

You MUST do this before the next deployment:

1. **Go to Repository Settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/jasonschurawel/jasonschurawel.github.io/settings
   ```

2. **Fix Actions Permissions:**
   - Click **"Actions"** → **"General"** in left sidebar
   - Under **"Workflow permissions"**, select:
     ✅ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check: ✅ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Configure GitHub Pages Source:**
   - Click **"Pages"** in left sidebar
   - Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - Click **"Save"**

## 🔧 **STEP 2: Updated Workflow**

I've updated your workflow to use the newer GitHub Pages deployment method that works better with permissions.

## 🚀 **STEP 3: Deploy Now**

After fixing the repository settings above:

```bash
# Add the updated workflow
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions permissions and deployment

- Update repository settings for write permissions
- Switch to actions/deploy-pages@v2 for better compatibility
- Add proper concurrency control
- Fix environment configuration"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 **STEP 4: Monitor Deployment**

1. Go to: https://github.com/jasonschurawel/jasonschurawel.github.io/actions
2. Watch the workflow run
3. If successful, your site will be at: https://jasonschurawel.github.io

## 🐛 **If It Still Fails**

If you still get permission errors, you may need to:

1. **Check if repository is public** (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)
2. **Manually create the Pages environment:**
   - Go to Settings → Environments
   - Click "New environment"
   - Name it "github-pages"
   - Add deployment protection rules if needed

## ✅ **What Changed**

- **Old method**: `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` (pushes to gh-pages branch)
- **New method**: `actions/deploy-pages@v2` (uses GitHub's official deployment API)
- **Better permissions**: Explicit environment and concurrency controls
- **More reliable**: Less prone to permission issues

The new method is recommended by GitHub and handles permissions more reliably!
